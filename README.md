<b>FINITE LOGIC: BlindQuery Engine - Homomorphic Proxy</b>

BlindQuery Engine provides a conceptual proxy layer for secure computation using principles of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). It allows systems to perform fundamental mathematical operations (like addition or subtraction) on data that remains encrypted throughout the process.

<b>Solved Problem: </b>

Allows companies to run mission-critical aggregate queries (e.g., calculating mean, sums, or simple ML inferences) over sensitive, distributed data without ever exposing the plaintext. This is the Zero-Trust approach to data analytics, enabling collaboration without compromising privacy.
