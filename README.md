<b>Focus: Runtime Language Optimization (JIT Profiling)</b>

<b>JIT Simulation and Dynamic Runtime Profiler</b>

<b>FINITE LOGIC: </b>PolyOptim is the core engine for high-resolution, just-in-time (JIT) simulation and dynamic profiling of complex runtime paths. This package provides the essential logic for performance-critical applications to analyze and simulate execution overhead before deployment.

This is the Community (Free) Tier NPM package, providing the raw, self-hosted algorithms.

<b>ðŸš€ Key Features: </b>

<b>JIT Simulation: </b>Predicts the latency and cost profile of various execution paths based on abstract resource consumption metrics.
<b>Path Profiling: </b>Allows for granular analysis of complex functions to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
<b>Local Execution: </b>Runs entirely within your Node.js environment, offering immediate feedback without external dependencies.
<b>Deterministic Benchmarking: </b>Provides consistent simulation results for reliable performance comparison.

ðŸ’¾ Installation (Community Tier)

This package is installed locally via npm:
<b>npm install @finite-logic/poly-optim</b>

<b>ðŸ’¡ Usage Example: </b>

Use the PolyOptimizer to simulate the execution of high and low-level resource-intensive tasks.

// Example: src/PolyOptimizer.js (The Entry Point)
const PolyOptimizer = require('@finite-logic/poly-optim');

// 1. Initialize the optimizer
const optimizer = new PolyOptimizer();

// 2. Define abstract tasks and their estimated resource costs
const highLevelTask = { name: "High-Level Data Aggregation", cost: 50 };
const lowLevelTask = { name: "Low-Level I/O Read", cost: 5 };

console.log("--- PolyOptim: JIT Simulation ---");

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    // Simulate running the task and get a result object
    const result = optimizer.simulatePath(i % 2 === 0 ? lowLevelTask : highLevelTask);
    
    console.log(
        `[Run ${i}] Path: ${result.pathName} | Duration: ${result.durationMs.toFixed(3)}ms`
    );
}

// Check the overall simulated performance profile
console.log("\nSimulated Total Runtime:", optimizer.getTotalRuntime().toFixed(2), "ms");


ðŸ“ˆ Unlock Professional Features (Managed Cloud Service)

While the Community package provides core logic, true dynamic, production-level optimization requires constant monitoring and real-time environment integration.

Upgrade to the FINITE LOGIC Professional Tier to unlock these gated features via a managed cloud API:
Paid Feature
Description
Dynamic Runtime Injector
Cloud-based service that auto-adjusts live environment variables (e.g., thread pools, memory limits) based on predicted load.
Predictive Capacity Forecasting
Utilizes global usage data to predict scaling needs and preemptively allocate resources before a spike occurs.
Real-Time Integration
Secure API hooks to automatically integrate with and optimize containerized environments (Kubernetes, AWS Lambda).

Centralized Dashboard

A single pane of glass for monitoring, profiling, and debugging performance bottlenecks across your entire microservice architecture.
